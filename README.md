## 💡 Problem Statement: Ex e s Man en

Companies often struggle with manual expense reimbursement processes that are time-consuming, error-prone, and lack transparency. There is no simple way to:

- Define approval flows based on thresholds.
- Manage multi-level approvals.
- Support flexible approval rules.

---

## 🚀 Solution: ExpensoX

ExpensoX tackles these problems by providing a robust platform for automated expense management with configurable approval flows and seamless user experience.

### 🔑 Core Features

#### 1. Authentication & User Management
- **First Login/Signup:** Auto-create a new Company (with environment-selected country’s currency) and Admin User.
- **Admin Functions:** Create Employees & Managers, assign/change roles (Employee, Manager), and define manager relationships.

#### 2. Expense Submission (Employee Role)
- **Submit Claims:** Amount (any currency), category, description, date, etc.
- **Expense History:** View all claims (Approved/Rejected).

#### 3. Approval Workflow (Manager/Admin Role)
- **Multi-Step Approval:** Expenses approved first by manager, then Finance, then Director, etc.
- **Sequenced Approvers:** Admin can define approval order.
- **Conditional Approval:** Approval by percentage (e.g., 60% of approvers), specific approver (e.g., CFO), or hybrid rules.

#### 4. Role Permissions

| Role     | Permissions |
|----------|-------------|
| Admin    | Create company, manage users, set roles, configure approval rules, view/override expenses |
| Manager  | Approve/reject expenses, view team expenses, escalate as per rules |
| Employee | Submit expenses, view own expenses, check approval status |

#### 5. Additional Features
- **OCR for Receipts:** Scan receipts to auto-generate expenses with all necessary fields (amount, date, description, expense type, name of restaurant, etc.).

---

## 🏆 How it Works

1. **Auto Company Creation:** On signup, a company is created with the selected country and currency.
2. **User Management:** Admin adds employees/managers and sets up team structure.
3. **Expense Submission:** Employees submit expenses, optionally scanning receipts with OCR.
4. **Approval Flows:** Expenses routed through configurable multi-level and conditional approval processes.
5. **Transparency:** Every action is logged, and users see real-time status updates.
